            Do Not disassemble the carburetors prior to shipping. Disassembly is

            Not all carburetors are repairable. We reserve the right to decline
            to repair any carburetor we deem not repairable. Sometimes due to
            neglect or damage they’re just too far gone.

            In these circumstances MOST MOTORSPORTS charges no fee for the
            diagnostic service. However you are still responsible for the
            shipping costs both ways.

            You understand and agree that when MOST MOTORSPORTS is “Rebuilding”
            your carburetors it is our mission to give you back carburetors that
            look good and are functioning at their highest level possible, but
            not necessarily, “show” quality. If you are restoring a bike and
            want it to look like new again, it may require additional cosmetic
            work.

            Prices apply to the majority of Late Model and Vintage carburetors
            but are not absolute. We reserve the right to either decline to
            “Clean”, “Rebuild”, or “Restore” carburetors for that fee or quote
            you a higher fee. This quote will be prior to the repair(s) and
            agreed to by you in order to cover our time on your carburetors.

            There is no “turn-around” guarantee with late mode or vintage
            carburetors. Many times we will be able to repair it within 48 hours
            of receiving it (Monday through Friday). However, your carburetors
            could be in the shop longer depending on it’s overall condition.
