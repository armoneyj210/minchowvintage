          For the protection of your carbs we beg you NOT to use foam peanut
          packing material.As the box is bounced around during shipping the foam
          peanuts will move and the carbs will NOT be adequately protected and
          can be damaged.
        </h4>
        <h4> DO NOT use air bags (they tend to deflate).</h4>{" "}
        <h4>DO NOT use home insulation (it turns into a NASTY mess).</h4>
        <h4>
          {" "}
          Please carefully wrap the carbs with a double layer of bubble wrap,
          (make sure to cover the carbs completely, top, bottom and sides.) Fill
          any voids in the box with balled up newspaper.
